		<h2>Timeless Space</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>spatial design / exhibition</strong>
			<b>Created together with Isa-Jane Ensing and Phila Hillie</b>
			Inspired by culture, this experience makes participants aware of their personal and subjective experience of time by magnifying and reflecting their bodily (and thereby indirectly mental) experience of time through the measuring of their heartbeat. The heart can be seen as a personal and internal ticking clock. To visualise this bodily experience of time, we explored how time can be made tangible and can be influenced. The final experience is an enclosed timeless space in which participants can experience their own unique sense of time.

		<h2>Dreamreader</h2>

			<strong>AI / image recognition</strong>
			<b>Created together with Rick Heemskerk</b>
			This intelligible AI creature is hooked up to a specialized computer that can accurately analyse the electric signals going through the creature. Optimized for this purpose, the computer can read and project the creature's thoughts, including a glimpse into its dreams when asleep. Interactions with the creature when awake will shape the creature's projected dreams, as well as your own.

		<h2>Bat Experience</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>sensory modalities / wearable / arduino</strong>
			<b>Created together with Yiming Tong and Xiaotian Ma</b>
			With various Arduino sensors, this project evokes a new understanding of our physical space and consciousness by adapting the interesting sensory experience that bats have, to humans. Bats navigate their environment using echolocation, they listen to ultrasonic sound that echoes off objects in a space for three-dimensional localization. By using an ultrasonic distance sensor in combination with headphones,  we made echolocation available to humans. By making the device wearable, humans can navigate through space as a bat. We used various other sensors and motors to make the bat experience complete.

		<h2>Cat-Computer Interaction</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>prize winning / animal-computer interaction / empirical research</strong>
			<b>Created together with Fatima Mashood, Isa-Jane Ensing and Yunjie Smeets</b>
			<i>A really impressive project. The inventiveness shown here is really quite something, both in the formulation of your design principles and the prototype testing. Also worth highlighting is the attention to detail with which you conducted the experiment.</i>
			Since domesticated animals such as cats are increasingly exposed to modern technologies, the field of cat-computer interaction (CCI) is explored in this research project. By extensively examining studies on CCI and investigating how technology can effectively cater to cats physical, cognitive, and emotional needs, we developed an overview of current findings as CCI principles. This includes five heuristics that cover the specific elements needed for successful cat-centered design and that can be applied when designing for CCI. As a first evaluation, the heuristic on cat vision was tested in an empirical experiment with three cats.

		<h2>Imperceivism</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>art / academic writing</strong>
			Imperceivism is a strategy of the arts involving interdisciplinary artworks that are not directly perceivable to our senses. It is possible for these artworks to contain perceivable elements, but only with the purpose to emphasize the immaterial aspect, which is the defining trait of the artwork.

		<h2>Dancing Osciloscope</h2>

			<strong>spacial design / music / puredata</strong>
			<b>Created together with Artur Dobija</b>
			Inspired by the oscilloscope, this instalation turns the room into a soundspace where you can dance (with a colorful hat on) to generate music. You can dance with multiple people or objects in the room, each composition shape (captured via a camera above the space) wil generate unique sound patterns.

		<h2>Evaluating Art-Based Science Communication of Quantum Physics</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>thesis / quantum / science communication / art / academic writing</strong>
			This research proposes art-based science communication as an effective approach for the science communication of quantum physics. To study the effects, an art-based intervention representing the quantum phenomenon of wave-particle duality was created. The intervention was exhibited in a public library, and its effects on citizens were evaluated using the framework from research group IMPACTLAB. The findings suggest that art-based science communication can be engaging and thereby effective in the science communication of complex and abstract scientific concepts such as quantum physics.

		<h2>Sprouting New Cosmologies: Decentering Space through Speculaitve Astrobotany</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>posthumanism / speculative / philosophy / academic writing</strong>
			This paper examines the entrenched anthropocentric paradigms in space exploration, decentering them through speculative fabulation by taking the stance of the easily overlooked but indispensable plants as astronauts, referred to as astrobotany. As a form of artistic research that embodies the plants’ perspective, the paper culminates in a speculative design envisioning the colonization of the exoplanet Proxima Centauri b by plants.

		<h2>Care Code</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>design / society / health</strong>
			<b>Created together with Ankita Sanjeevi, Chisanga Mukuka, Jessica Priscyla Tallabas Ezqueda, Michelle Bak and Yousef Lebbad</b>
			<i>Anna is bright and incredibly creative. Whether the team needed illustrations, design mockups, or creative concepts, she consistently delivered high-quality work, and often in a short amount of time. I was really impressed by how she faced every challenge head-on, and always with a smile.</i>
			From September 2020 to January 2021 I joined a traineeship at the Digital Society School. Here I intensively collaborated with an international and interdisciplinary team. We worked for the Dutch Centrum voor Transculturele Psychiatrie Veldzicht and Dienst Justitiële Inrichtingen (DJI) on a project about improving the communication between multicultural patients with a mental health condition and their caregivers. With a creative conversation starter named Care Code as the final product.

			<i>What makes Anna distinctive is that she knows how to involve the target group with great tact and empathy, as well as being very capable of creating attractive and feasible concepts in a creative way and based on the needs of the target group and goals of the client.</i>
			For parents of children with acquired brain injury, I worked on an expansion of the social platform Breinstraat. The final product is a dynamic webapp that captures the needs of the target group: relevant information, an overview of options and practical solutions.
